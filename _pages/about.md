I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at China Agricultural University (CAU), where I conduct interdisciplinary research on developing large language models (LLMs) for applications in animal science. Previously, from  2024-08  to July 2025-08, I worked as an LLM development engineer at CNIGC.

I received my Ph.D. in 2024 from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), under the supervision of Professor [Dawei Song](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=PCTA8yAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). During my doctoral studies, my research primarily focused on the controllability of large language models in text generation, aiming to ensure that the generated content aligns with human expectations and values. Prior to that, I earned my master's and bachelor's degrees from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) and Harbin Engineering University (HEU) in 2020 and 2017, respectively.

Interested research directions
======
 - Explore the relationship between memory and reasoning in LLMs, identify efficient methods to control these modes, and enhance the LLM's performance on memory- and reasoning-intensive tasks.
 
 - Identify efficient and essential methods for developing domain-specific LLMs, with a focus on animal sciences. My primary interests lie in the following sub-areas: (1) Data synthesis techniques using general-purpose LLMs to train domain-specific Small Language Models (SLMs)   (2) Mechanisms of interaction between domain-specific SLMs and general LLMs, aiming to adapt the capabilities of general models to specialized domains at minimal cost.

  - Develop LLM agents tailored for domain-specific AI applications. For example, create an intelligent assessment agent to address challenges in livestock farming, offering management insights and optimization suggestions for the farm.
